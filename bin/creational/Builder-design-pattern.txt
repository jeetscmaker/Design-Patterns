“Separate the construction of a complex object from its representation so that the same
 construction process can create different representations.”

 Introduction to the Builder Pattern
 ===================================
 The builder pattern allows you to enforce a step-by-step process to construct a complex
 object as a finished product. In this pattern, the step-by-step construction process
 remains same but the finished products can have different representations. In the context
 of the house building example, the step-by-step process includes the steps to create the
 foundation, structure, and roof followed by the steps to paint and furnish a house and
 these steps remain the same irrespective of the type of house to build. The finished product,
 which is a house, can have different representations. That is, it can be a concrete house,
 a prefabricated house, or a tree house.
